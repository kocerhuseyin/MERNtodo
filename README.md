# MERNtodo
This is a simple full stack To-Do list application, built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The application allows users to create tasks, display the tasks, and delete tasks as desired.

## Features

- **Create tasks:** Users can create new tasks, which are then added to a list of tasks.
- **Display tasks:** All tasks are displayed to the user in a list format.
- **Delete tasks:** Users have the option to delete tasks once they are done with them.

## Technologies

- Front-end: React.js
- Back-end: Node.js & Express
- Database: MongoDB

This application provides a simple but practical demonstration of how a MERN stack application functions, and can serve as a starting point for more complex applications.
